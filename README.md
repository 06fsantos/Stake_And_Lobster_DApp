# Stake and Lobster - DeFi Staking Project 

Stake and Lobster is a DeFi staking DApp built using Python and Typescript that allows you to stake (currently) DAI and ETH in exchange for our own token. 

The front-end is built using react and the Brownie framework is used to build, deploy and test the Solidity contracts.

## Next Steps
- Complete unstaking portion of page
- Restructure as a Django project to allow platform growth
- Build dashboard for price monitoring using Chainlink Price Feeds
- Integrate staking with established platforms (maybe AAVE and Compound)
    - Build tool for switching between established platforms to maximise returns
